# react-native-musicplayer-ui
[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)

üéß  Pure javascript music player user interface prototype for React Native framework. 

I will add more views in the future. and feel free to use this

## Run it locally

To install, there are two steps:

1. Clone this repo and run `npm install`
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/gedeagas/react-native-musicplayer-ui.git musicplayer

  cd musicplayer
  npm install
  ```
2. Run the project with react-native run command.

### Optional
Because npm is not been able to recognize react native dependency on v0.44 you may have to install lottie with yarn.
Todo so you can run this command ( in musicplayer directory )
```bash
  yarn add lottie-react-native
```
