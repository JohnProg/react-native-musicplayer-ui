## Run it locally

To install, there are two steps:

1. Clone this repo and run `npm install`
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/gedeagas/react-native-musicplayer-ui.git musicplayer

  cd musicplayer
  npm install
  ```
2. Run the project with react-native run command.

### Optional
Because npm is not been able to recognize react native dependency on v0.44 you may have to install lottie with yarn.
Todo so you can run this command ( in musicplayer directory )
```bash
  yarn add lottie-react-native
```

### Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the
project's developers might not want to merge into the project.
